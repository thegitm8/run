# RUN
Node.js/NPM script runner written in BASH

Think of RUN as `npm run` with superpowers. Scripts is a second class citizen in npm, which is good (it's a package manager, not a script runner), but inconvenient. RUN solves this by making npm scripts first class citizens and adding more functionality and extensions to it.
